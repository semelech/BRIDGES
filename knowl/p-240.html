<div class="para">Tree structures are valuable for managing extensive data collections efficiently. Among various tree structures, binary trees are commonly employed and relatively straightforward to implement. Although binary trees are frequently used for searching purposes, their applications extend beyond that. They can accelerate tasks such as job prioritization, representing mathematical expressions and program syntax, and organizing data for compression algorithms. In this chapter, we will explore the terminology associated with binary trees, methods for traversing trees, techniques for implementing tree nodes, and several examples of binary trees.</div>
