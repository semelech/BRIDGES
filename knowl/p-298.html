<div class="para">One implementation of closed hashing involves grouping hash table slots into buckets. The M slots of the hash table are divided into B buckets, each containing M/B slots. Records are assigned to the first available slot within a bucket based on the hash function. If a slot is already taken, the bucket slots are searched sequentially until an open slot is found. If a bucket becomes full, records are stored in an overflow bucket with infinite capacity located at the end of the table. All buckets share the same overflow bucket. A well-designed implementation uses a hash function that evenly distributes records among the buckets to minimize the use of the overflow bucket.</div>
