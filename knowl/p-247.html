<div class="para">In some cases, we may want to visit each node in a binary tree only after visiting its children and their subtrees. This is necessary, for example, when we want to free up memory by deleting all nodes in the tree. We need to delete the children of a node before deleting the node itself. However, to do this, we must first delete the children's children, and so on. This type of traversal, where we visit the children nodes first and then the parent node, is known as a postorder traversal.</div>
