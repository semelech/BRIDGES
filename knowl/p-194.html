<div class="para">Although the best case for Insertion Sort is considerably faster than the average and worst cases, the average and worst cases provide more reliable estimates of the typical running time. However, there are scenarios where we can anticipate the input to be already sorted or nearly sorted. In such cases, Insertion Sort can be a suitable choice, especially when the disordering is minor. Even when the input is not perfectly sorted, Insertion Sort's performance is proportional to the number of inversions, making it efficient for "nearly sorted" lists. Shellsort and Quicksort are examples of algorithms that leverage Insertion Sort's near-best-case running time.</div>
