<div class="para">Now, let's focus on the most commonly used form of hashing: closed hashing without bucketing, which employs a collision resolution policy that can potentially use any slot in the hash table. When inserting a record, collision resolution aims to find a free slot in the hash table if the record's home position is already taken. We can think of collision resolution methods as generating a sequence of hash table slots that may accommodate the record. The first slot in the sequence is the home position for the key. If it's occupied, the collision resolution policy moves to the next slot in the sequence. If that slot is also taken, it searches for another, and so on. This sequence of slots is called the probe sequence, generated by a probe function we'll call p.</div>
