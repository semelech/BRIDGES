<div class="para">The rules governing reference structures remain concise, regardless of their complexity. A reference variable serves as a container for storing a reference to its associated pointee. The pointee itself holds valuable information or data. To access the content of a reference, the dereference operation is used. However, it is crucial to note that a reference can only be dereferenced once it has been assigned to a valid pointee. Many issues or errors related to references occur when this rule is violated. Allocating a reference does not automatically assign it to refer to a specific pointee. The act of assigning the reference to a particular pointee is a distinct operation that can sometimes be overlooked. When two references are assigned to each other, they start referring to the same pointee. This allows for object sharing, enabling multiple references to access and manipulate the same underlying object.</div>
