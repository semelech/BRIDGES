<div class="para">This perspective of problems behaving like mathematical functions may differ from your intuition about how computer programs operate. You may be aware of programs where the same input value produces different outputs on separate occasions. For example, entering the "date" command in a typical Linux command line prompt provides the current date, which naturally changes with each day. However, there is more to the input of the "date" program than just the command entered. The program computes a function, and on any given day, a properly functioning "date" program with a fully specified input will always produce a single answer. The output of any computer program is entirely determined by the program's complete set of inputs. Even a "random number generator" is entirely determined by its inputs (although some random number generation systems seem to circumvent this by incorporating random inputs from external physical processes beyond the user's control). The scope of functions implementable by programs falls within the realm of Computability.</div>
