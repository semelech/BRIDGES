<div class="para">In a hash system, records are stored in an array known as a hash table (HT). Hashing involves computing a hash function (denoted as h) on a search key K to identify the position in HT where the record with key K should be placed. As records are stored based on the address calculation, they are not ordered by value. Each position in the hash table is referred to as a slot, with the number of slots denoted by M, starting from 0 to M-1.</div>
