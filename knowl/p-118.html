<div class="para">The requirement for an algorithm to terminate means that not all computer programs align with the technical definition of an algorithm. An example is your operating system. Nonetheless, it is possible to consider the different tasks performed by an operating system, each with its associated inputs and outputs, as individual problems. These problems can be addressed by specific algorithms implemented within different parts of the operating system program. Each algorithm terminates once it produces the desired output for its respective problem.</div>
