<div class="para">When analyzing an algorithm, we often contemplate whether to study its best, worst, or average case. Typically, the best case is not of great interest since it tends to occur rarely and may present an overly optimistic depiction of the algorithm's runtime. Analyzing the best case is not usually representative of the algorithm's behavior. However, there are exceptional scenarios where a best-case analysis proves valuable, especially when the best case is highly likely to occur. For instance, the Shellsort and Quicksort algorithms leverage the best-case running time of Insertion Sort to enhance their efficiency.</div>
