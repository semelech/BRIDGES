<div class="para">However, hashing may not be suitable for applications that permit multiple records with the same key value or when answering range searches. It cannot easily find all records within a specific range or determine the minimum or maximum key value or visit records in key order. Yet, hashing excels at answering exact-match queries, making it the preferred search method for such applications when implemented correctly. Despite its efficiency, there are various approaches to hashing, and inefficient implementations can be devised. Hashing is suitable for both in-memory and disk-based searching and is one of the most widely used methods for organizing large databases stored on disk, alongside the B-tree.</div>
