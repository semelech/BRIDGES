<div class="para">Closed hashing stores all records directly in the hash table. Each record with a key value kR has a home position at h(kR), which is computed by the hash function. If the home position is occupied during insertion, the record is stored in another slot within the table, and the collision resolution policy determines which slot that will be. This policy is also followed during search to retrieve any record not found in its home position, repeating the collision resolution process.</div>
