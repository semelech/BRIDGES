<div class="para">We often perceive a computer program as a specific instance or tangible representation of an algorithm in a programming language. Algorithms are typically described in terms of programs or sections of programs. Naturally, multiple programs can be instances of the same algorithm since various modern programming languages can be used to implement the same set of algorithms (although some languages may offer more programmer-friendly features). In practice, the terms "algorithm" and "program" are often used interchangeably, even though they represent distinct concepts. However, by definition, an algorithm must provide sufficient detail to allow its conversion into a program when necessary.</div>
