<div class="para">Frequently, we have the need to traverse a binary tree and perform a specific action on each node, such as printing its contents. This process of visiting all the nodes in a specific order is known as a traversal. An enumeration of the tree's nodes is a traversal that lists every node exactly once. In certain applications, the order in which nodes are visited may not matter as long as each node is visited only once. However, for other applications, it is crucial to visit the nodes in an order that preserves a specific relationship.</div>
