<div class="para">Similarly, the term "array" can refer to both a data type and an implementation. In computer programming, "array" commonly denotes a contiguous block of memory locations, where each location stores a fixed-length data item. In this sense, an array is a physical data structure. However, "array" can also denote a logical data type consisting of a collection of data items, typically of the same type, each identified by an index number. Arrays can be implemented in various ways beyond a contiguous block of memory locations. For instance, a sparse matrix is a large two-dimensional array that only stores a relatively small number of non-zero values. It can be implemented using a linked structure or a hash table, while still providing the same interface as if it were implemented as a block of contiguous memory locations using traditional row and column indices.</div>
