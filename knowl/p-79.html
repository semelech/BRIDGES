<div class="para">It is an essential reminder that people develop programs to solve problems, yet programmers sometimes overlook this fact. Therefore, it is crucial to always bear this truth in mind when choosing a data structure to tackle a specific problem. The first step towards selecting the right data structure is analyzing the problem and determining the performance objectives that must be met. Without this initial analysis, program designers often make the mistake of using a familiar but inappropriate data structure, resulting in a slow program. Conversely, there is no point in adopting a complex representation to "enhance" a program that can achieve its performance goals through a simpler design.</div>
