<div class="para">However, our history of computer development has shown that as computing power increases, we tend to tackle increasingly complex problems. This can take the form of more sophisticated user interfaces, larger problem sizes, or previously unsolvable computational challenges. With more complex problems, the demand for computation grows, amplifying the need for efficient programs. Unfortunately, as tasks become more intricate, they often deviate from our everyday experiences. Therefore, today's computer scientists must be well-versed in the principles of efficient program design because their everyday intuitions may not directly apply in the realm of computer programming.</div>
