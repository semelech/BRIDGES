<div class="para">A Dictionary (sometimes called associative arrays) enable to store and retrieve (key, value) pairs. In this assignment, they will be useful to count how many times a particular word appears in Shakespeare's work. The keys are going to be words. And the value associated with that key is going to be how many times that word appears. You will be building the hashmap yourself given the scaffolded code. The only file you will need to edit is the HashTabel.java file.</div>
