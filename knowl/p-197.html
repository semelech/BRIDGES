<div class="para">Let's revisit the task of sorting a stack of phone bills for the past year. Another intuitive approach would be to go through the pile and find the bill for January, setting it aside. Then continue searching for the bill for February and place it after January. Repeat this process with the remaining bills, selecting and arranging them in order until you reach the end. This approach serves as the basis for our last Î˜(n^2) sorting algorithm, known as Selection Sort.</div>
