<div class="para">This course does not provide anywhere near a comprehensive review of the UML. The intent is to introduce you to the basics you need to understand the designs presented in this course. Since there is an excellent chance you will encounter the UML or something very similar to it in your professional career and the diagrams used in this course are used not only in the UML, but in other modeling systems as well.</div>
