<div class="para">Traditionally, the analysis of sorting algorithms focuses on measuring the cost in terms of the number of comparisons made between keys. This measure is closely related to the actual running time and offers the advantage of being independent of the specific machine or data type used. However, in certain cases, if the records are large, the physical movement of records during sorting can contribute significantly to the overall running time. In such situations, it may be appropriate to measure the cost by counting the number of swap operations performed by the algorithm. In most applications, it is assumed that all records and keys have a fixed length, and that comparisons and swaps have a constant time complexity regardless of the keys involved. However, special situations arise where the rules for comparing sorting algorithms change. For example, when dealing with records or keys of varying lengths (e.g., sorting variable-length strings), not all comparisons can be assumed to have roughly the same cost. These scenarios require specific analysis techniques and often benefit from specialized sorting techniques tailored to the specific requirements.</div>
