<div class="para">The Unified Modeling Language, or UML, is an industry standard graphical notation for describing and analysing software designs. The symbols and graphs used in the UML are an outgrowth of efforts in the 1980’s and early 1990’s to devise standards for Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE). UML represents a unification of these efforts. In 1994 - 1995 several leaders in the development of modeling languages, Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh, attempted to unify their work. To eliminate the method fragmentation that they concluded was impeding commercial adoption of modeling tools, they developed UML, which provided a level playing field for all tool vendors.</div>
