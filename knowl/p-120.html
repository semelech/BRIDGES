<div class="para">However, for various applications, especially when considering the cumulative cost of executing the program on multiple inputs, analyzing the worst case may not be an accurate measure of the algorithm's overall performance. In such instances, the preferred approach is often to examine the average-case running time. This allows us to understand the algorithm's typical behavior when handling inputs of size n. Nevertheless, conducting an average-case analysis is not always feasible. It requires a thorough understanding of how the actual inputs and their associated costs are distributed among all possible inputs to the program. For example, it was mentioned previously that the average-case performance of the sequential search algorithm involves examining half of the array values. However, this holds true only if the element with value K is equally likely to appear in any position within the array. If this assumption is incorrect, the algorithm may not examine half of the array values on average.</div>
