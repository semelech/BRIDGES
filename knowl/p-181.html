<div class="para">Sorting remains an active field of research, with ongoing efforts to refine existing algorithms and develop new ones tailored for specific applications. Exploring sorting algorithms not only introduces us to this fundamental problem in computer science but also delves into algorithm design and analysis. We learn different techniques, such as divide and conquer, demonstrated by various sorting approaches. Additionally, sorting algorithms offer valuable insights into algorithm analysis, showcasing variations in growth rates between average and worst cases, exploiting best-case behaviors of other algorithms, and leveraging special-case behaviors for niche applications. Sorting also provides an opportunity to explore lower bound analysis, particularly in the context of external sorting, which deals with sorting large files stored on disk.</div>
