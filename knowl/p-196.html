<div class="para">As we delve into algorithms with superior growth rates, Insertion Sort becomes less favorable for larger arrays. It is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for most situations. However, there are specific scenarios where it excels, such as when the input is already sorted or when working with very small arrays. Other algorithms with better asymptotic growth rates tend to be more complex, leading to larger constant factors in their running time. While they require fewer comparisons for larger arrays, their cost per comparison is higher. Although this observation may seem less beneficial, there are instances where numerous sorting operations are performed on very small arrays.</div>
