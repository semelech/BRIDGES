<div class="para">Remember that it is our objective to work in small steps to make sure we will never experience a sudden and unexpected test success or test failure. In practice, most developers take increasingly bigger steps, with the result of frequent surprises when they run their tests. That's where we will hopefully distinguish ourselves as test-first masters by making giant steps when moving in well-known territory and making very tiny forward and sideward steps in unknown terrain and on slippery ground. However, this strategy requires that we know how to make the tiny steps in the first place.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-JUintExample.html#li-8" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
