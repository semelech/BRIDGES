<div class="para">An algorithm or function is considered recursive when it calls itself to perform a portion of its task. Recursion offers a way to solve complex problems using concise, easily understandable, and efficient programs. It involves breaking down a large problem into one or more sub-problems that have the same structure as the original problem but are simpler to solve. This process continues until the sub-problems become straightforward enough to be solved without further division. The final solution is then obtained by combining the solved components.</div>
