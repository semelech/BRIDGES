<div class="para">An efficient solution is one that solves the problem while adhering to the required resource constraints. These constraints can include the available space to store data (which may involve separate constraints for main memory and disk space) and the allotted time for each subtask. Sometimes, a solution is deemed efficient if it utilizes fewer resources than known alternatives, regardless of meeting specific requirements. The cost of a solution refers to the amount of resources it consumes. Typically, cost is measured in terms of a key resource, such as time, assuming that the solution fulfills other resource constraints as well.</div>
