<div class="para">A recursive data structure is a data structure that includes smaller or simpler instances of the same data structure within itself. Linked lists and binary trees are examples of recursive data structures. In a linked list, it can be defined as either an empty list or a node followed by another list. Similarly, a binary tree is commonly defined as an empty tree or a node connected to two binary trees, one serving as its left child and the other as its right child.</div>
