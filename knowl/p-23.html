<div class="para">Software evolves over time. Thus, we should adapt to change rather than stick to a strict plan. Software development is a collaborative process: many individuals work on different parts of the software to build something that meets customer needs, and different individuals perform different roles iteratively to determine a product's future. We work with new technologies, ever-changing requirements, people movement, or a combination of these. All of these determine that software projects involve a lot of uncertainties. People say that the only constant is uncertainty. To overcome the fear and manage these uncertainties, we need a software development practice that can help us produce working software. It must keep things simple and provide us quick feedback in case things go wrong. We need to verify the working software when change happens.</div>
