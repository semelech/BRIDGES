<div class="para">Imagine you have a stack of phone bills from the past two years, and you want to arrange them in order by date. A natural way to tackle this task is to start with the first two bills and put them in the correct order. Then, take the third bill and place it in its proper position relative to the first two bills. You continue this process, taking each bill and adding it to the already sorted pile. This simple approach serves as the foundation for our first sorting algorithm, known as Insertion Sort.</div>
