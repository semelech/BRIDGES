<div class="para">A problem can be understood as a task that needs to be accomplished, typically described in terms of inputs and desired outputs. It is crucial to define a problem precisely, focusing on inputs and matching outputs, without specifying the solution method. Constraints on the resources allowable for a solution should be included in the problem definition. Every problem solvable by a computer is subject to such constraints, whether explicitly stated or implied. For instance, a computer program can only utilize available main memory and disk space, and it should execute within a reasonable timeframe.</div>
